# Sahayata Nidhi

**Sahayata Nidhi** is a government-backed financial assistance platform developed under the **Social Welfare Department**. It enables citizens from economically weaker sections to apply for monetary aid, track their application status, and receive funds through a secure, multi-stage officer workflow.

The system promotes transparency, speed, and accountability using a digital-first, multilingual interface with dynamic workflow creation, secure authentication, and integrated digital signatures.
